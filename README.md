# Campaign Data Dashboard
## Background
From March to November 2020, I was part of a team of Bluebonnet Data Fellows working on Donna Imam's campaign for the congressional seat in Texas's 31st District. I initially created this Dash page as a way to examine correlations between a mix of demographic variables and election results broken down by precinct, combining chloropleth maps with scatter and bar plots so as not to lose a geographic context that can often be important in these settings. Over time, I ended up adapting it for a variety of purposes, including turfcutting and live vote tracking.
